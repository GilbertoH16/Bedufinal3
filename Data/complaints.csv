XXXX. ( I have been desperately trying to get to XXXX but unfortunately have only gotten to XXXX. ) My personal and financial information is very important to me and not taken lightly. I have taken great pride in establishing and maintaining my high XXXX XXXX and have NEVER been late on a mortgage payment, installment loan or credit card payment. So I don't need to emphasize how angry I was when I was informed that I was denied by XXXX loan companies for my XXXX loan for absolutely ridiculous reasons ... *Lack of recent installment loan information .. *Too few accounts currently paid as agreed .. *No recent revolving balances .. *Length of time accounts have been established XXXX of recent auto loan information. 

I opened my first checking account and my first credit card account ( XXXX ) when I was XXXX. I have had XXXX mortgages, approximately XXXX car loans, at least XXXX installment loans for various items ( snowmobiles, jet skis, ATV/UTV, golf cart, storage building, etc. ) and close to XXXX different credit cards for department stores. So at XXXX XXXX XXXX, that denial for my loan was absolutely absurd... especially with {$25000.00} down. 

I have contacted all XXXX major credit bureaus, the XXXX loan companies and also CFPB disputing the erroneous error that has occurred on my credit report. I told them the reason I believed this discrepancy has transpired and it was like talking to a wall! I was on the phone with Experian and XXXX yesterday for XXXX hours ... transferred 6 times ... requested to speak to a supervisor ( who wouldn't even give me her name ) and was told by another XXXX representative that I should contact ALL the accounts that I have had in the past and have them document again my credit history. Is that about the most lunatic idea imaginable... especially since a lot of companies are no longer in business or outdated records. 

I legally changed my FIRST name 2 years ago ( XXXX  ) ... which was my LAST name for 37 years ( XXXX ). I also remarried in XXXX  and changed my last name. My question is ... why the credit bureaus can't just simply change my name on my credit reports to my legal name. The Social Security XXXX didn't have an issue with changing the name on my social security card nor did the Driver 's XXXX XXXX with issuing me a new license and voters registration card with my legal name. 

Due to the XXXX epidemic and everyone working remotely... with very little work getting accomplished ( which I might add ) ... some companies have gotten too laxed and slipshod in managing their employees productivity ... and oblivious to the process that is required to provide efficient and effective work ethics.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,MS,39740,"Older American, Servicemember",Consent provided,Web,2023-01-31,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,6510321

I honestly do not believe to ever have any relationship with this collection agency or original creditor. Also there are several inaccuracies with this account the way it's reporting and that's a total violation of FCRA and FDCPA laws and regulations. In a good faith effort to resolve the matter amicably, I must demand proof of this debt, specifically the alleged contract or other instrument bearing my signature, as well as proof of your authority in this matter. Absent such proof, you must correct any erroneous reports of this past debt as mine. I am writing to request that you please provide the following information : 1. Please evidence your authorization under 15 USC 1692 ( e ) and 15 USC 1692 ( f ) in this alleged matter. 2. What is your authorization of law for your collection of information? 3. What is your authorization of law for your collection of this alleged debt? 4. Please evidence your authorization to do business or operate in this state. 5. Please evidence proof of the alleged debt, including the alleged contract or other instrument bearing my signature. 6.
